# CS 201 Public Autograder Tests

Assignments in this course may be submitted to two batteries of tests.
The first set of tests (this one) is publicly accessible to allow students to
verify that their formatting matches the specification. A second, private suite
of tests may be used to evaluate submissions to prevent "coding to the tests".
